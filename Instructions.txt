# Step 2

# Run virtual audio cable app and click Install or something similar to that, it will just show a button to install it.
# Do the same with VoiceMeeter Banana

# Step 3

# Go to sound settings on Windows
# Change input device on your computer to VoiceMeeter Output
# Change output device to VoiceMeeter Input

# Step 4

# Go to Sound Control Panel (windows 10 | windows 11 should either be more sound settings or advanced sound settings)
# Go to your active input and output devices and select Properties
# Go to advanced tab and uncheck "Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device", do this for all of your active devices including voicemeeter and virtual audio cable stuff


# Step 5

# Open VoiceMeeter Banana (if not already opened)
# Change stereo input 1 to your microphone device
# Change stereo input 2 to Cable Output (VB-Audio..)
# Change Hardware Out to your headphones or speaker

# Step 6

# Install Python 3.11 if not already installed, I personally install it from Microsoft Store as its easier for me.

# Step 7

# Install visual studio code if not already installed
# https://code.visualstudio.com/
# Once downloaded, open it and create a new folder, then create a file in that folder called "Jerome.py" or whatever you would like to name it.
# Paste this code into the Jerome.py file.
# Run the code.


# Step 8

# Get a Gemini API Key
# https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api (it's free!)
# Once you have the key, save it to a .txt file
# Paste your key into the input when the code is running.

# Step 9

# Make sure your input and output devices are correct
# Speak to Jerome through your microphone, make sure you are in Roblox and it is a active window.

# Step 10

# If you want yourself to speak to Jerome only, change output device in Roblox to your headphones and not VoiceMeeter Input.
# If you want other people to speak to Jerome, dont change output device in Roblox if its VoiceMeeter Input already.
